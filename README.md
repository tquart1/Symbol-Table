# Symbol-Table
Developed a symbol table for storing identifiers.
An identifier was used 
for naming variables, methods, classes, etc. in  the program. Used an array of linked lists to store information in the table.


The Symbol Table class is a collection of identifier nodes, and an identifier node is a collection of line num nodes.

Client class included to test that a new empty symbol table is created and allows the user to enter in identifiers and line num where each is
supposed to be found.
